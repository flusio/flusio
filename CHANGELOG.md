# Changelog of flusio

## 2021-03-xx - v0.18

### Breaking changes

If `APP_DEMO` is true, the reset of the application is now automatically done
via a scheduled job. The `make reset-demo` target is removed, you should remove
your cron task if you had one.

If you’ve set the subscription system, the sync cron task must be removed as
well (a scheduled job is running every 4 hours).

## 2021-02-23 - v0.17

### Breaking changes

Validation emails are now sent asynchronously by a jobs worker. First of all,
you must make sure to have installed the `pcntl` PHP extension. Then, please
have a look to the production documentation to learn how to setup the worker.

If you want to setup the Pocket importation system, you’ll have to create a
Pocket "consumer key". More information in the production documentation.

(optional) flusio now supports Open Graph and Twitter Cards images. For oldest
links, you can refresh their image by running the following command:

flusio$ php cli --request /links/refresh -pnumber=NUMBER

## 2020-10-21 - v0.11

### Breaking changes

The ids of collections and links are changing to a numeric form, which means
previous URLs will break. This is not a change that I would do if the service
was open or installed by other people, at least not in a >= 1.0 release. Since
I'm almost the only person using it today and that I shared very few URLs, it’s
OK for me to do it. It's also the last occasion to make this change (or it
would require more work).

### Migration notes

(optional, mostly for myself) You can configure the subscription feature with
the `APP_SUBSCRIPTIONS_*` environment variables. Read production documentation
for more details.

- Generate user CSRF token directly instead of calling `Minz\CSRF`

### Misc

- Update Minz version
- Fix the locale in User factory

  `format_date()` function
